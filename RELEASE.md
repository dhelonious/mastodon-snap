## Upgrade notes

Due to the changes described above, you may need to manually change the `status.length` option after the upgrade, e.g:

    snap set mastodon-server status.length=5000

However, the new default value of `status.length=1000` doubles Mastodon's default value of 500 and should be sufficient for most users.

You can also clean up the old snap variables with:

    snap unset mastodon-server status.char-limit status.char-counter
